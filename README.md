# ExaTron.jl

ExaTron is the Julia implementaion of novel GPU-accelerated algorithm for bound-constrained nonlinear nonconvex optimization problems of the form
```math
\min_x \; f(x) \; \text{subject to} \; l \leq x \leq u,
```
where ``x \in \mathbf{R}^d`` is the optimization variable and ``l,u \in \mathbf{R}^d \cup \{-\infty,\infty\}^d`` are respectively lower and upper bounds (allowing negative and positive infinite values).
Bound constraints hold componentwise, and the objective function ``f: \mathbf{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbf{R}`` is a generic nonlinear nonconvex function.
Bound-constrained problems play an important role as a building block to solve problems with more general constraints such as ``h(x)=0``, where ``h`` is a linear or a nonlinear function.
The algorithm is a variant of [TRON (Lin and Mor√©, 1999)](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~more/tron) with the complete Cholesky factorization for preconditioning, which has been carefully designed for solving extremely many small nonlinear problems as GPU batching.

## Use Case: Distributed Optimization of ACOPF

This presents the use case of `ExaTron.jl` for solving large-scale alternating current optimal power flow (ACOPF) problem.
In this pacakge, we also provide the implementation of adaptive ADMM for distributed ACOPF introduced by [Mhanna et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2018.2886344). We have implemented the ADMM algorithm fully on GPUs without data transfer to the CPU, where `ExaTron.jl` is used to solve many small nonlinear nonconvex problems, each of which represents a branch subproblem of the ADMM. See details in the documentation.
