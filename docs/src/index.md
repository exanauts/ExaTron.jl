# ExaTron.jl Documentation

ExaTron is the Julia implementaion of novel GPU-accelerated algorithm for bound-constrained nonlinear nonconvex optimization problems of the form
```math
\min_x \; f(x) \; \text{subject to} \; l \leq x \leq u,
```
where ``x \in \mathbf{R}^d`` is the optimization variable and ``l,u \in \mathbf{R}^d \cup \{-\infty,\infty\}^d`` are respectively lower and upper bounds (allowing negative and positive infinite values).
Bound constraints hold componentwise, and the objective function ``f: \mathbf{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbf{R}`` is a generic nonlinear nonconvex function.
Bound-constrained problems play an important role as a building block to solve problems with more general constraints such as ``h(x)=0``, where ``h`` is a linear or a nonlinear function.
The algorithm is a variant of [TRON (Lin and Mor√©, 1999)](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~more/tron) with the complete Cholesky factorization for preconditioning, which has been carefully designed for solving extremely many small nonlinear problems as GPU batching.

This package also provides the implementation of adaptive ADMM for solving large-scale alternating current optimal power flow by using the algorithm on multiple NVIDIA GPUs (or CPUs).
